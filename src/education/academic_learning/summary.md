# Academic Learning
The difference from between academic and colloquial learning is the higher expectations on the academic materials. The learning material is usually more dry but the facts and information is provided by actual professionals in the specific field. 

**Disclaimer:** academic vs. colloquial should be compared as opposites, but each supplemental to each other. Keep in mind some people learn quicker with a more entertaining setting with colloquial material than academic, and vice versa. There's not right or wrong on how you learn because it's your own journey. Also, the colloquial material is probably passed down from academic materials so there won't be too much lost in translation...
